        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Meatballs</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and milk. Let them sit for a few minutes until the breadcrumbs have absorbed the milk.</li>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, ground pork, finely chopped onion, soaked breadcrumbs, egg, salt, pepper, allspice, and nutmeg. Mix everything thoroughly until well combined.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Shape the Meatballs:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>With wet hands to prevent sticking, roll the mixture into small meatballs, about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. You should get approximately 30-40 meatballs from this mixture.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fry the Meatballs:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the same skillet, add a bit more butter or oil if needed.</li>    
                    <li>Sprinkle the flour into the skillet and whisk it into the remaining fat to create a roux. Cook for a minute or two until it turns lightly golden.</li>
                    <li>Gradually whisk in the beef or vegetable broth and heavy cream, ensuring there are no lumps.</li>
                    <li>Simmer the gravy, stirring constantly, until it thickens, which should take about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Season the gravy with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Combine and Serve:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the cooked meatballs back to the skillet with the gravy.</li>
                    <li>Simmer for a few more minutes until the meatballs are heated through and the flavors meld.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Serve:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Serve the Swedish meatballs hot with lingonberry sauce on the side, and optionally, over a bed of egg noodles or mashed potatoes.</li>
                </ul>
