            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Vegetables:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté for a few minutes until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
                        <li>Add the grated beets, carrots, and diced potatoes to the pot. Sauté for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to soften and the beets release their color.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Add Liquids and Seasonings:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pour in the vegetable broth and water. Add the bay leaves and dried dill (if using fresh dill, reserve it for garnish).</li>
                        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook for about 20-25 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Season and Finish:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stir in the white vinegar, salt, and pepper. Start with a tablespoon of vinegar and adjust to taste. The vinegar gives borscht its characteristic tang.</li>
                        <li>Remove the bay leaves.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Serve:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ladle the hot borscht into bowls. You can serve it as is or top each bowl with a dollop of sour cream or yogurt and a sprinkle of fresh dill or parsley for added flavor and garnish.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Optional Step for Cold Borscht:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you want to serve cold borscht, let it cool to room temperature and then refrigerate it for several hours or overnight before serving. Cold borscht is a refreshing summer dish.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
